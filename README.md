The Secretary Problem is a classic problem in decision theory that involves selecting the best candidate from a pool of applicants who are interviewed sequentially.\
A graph reflecting the probability of choosing the best candidate at random and using the optimal strategy (Obtained Theoretically):\

A similar graph, but already built according to Monte Carlo simulation data. For each n, 10e5 runs were performed and the average probability of choosing the best candidate with the appropriate strategies was taken:\
